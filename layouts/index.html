        <p>
            Hi, my name is Hugues Huygens,
            I'm a freelance software engineer specialised in web development with a strong focus on user experience and
            user interface design.
        </p>

        <p>
            After working a little more than 15 years as an employee under the wings of a big <a href="#">American
            company</a> the time had come to spread my wings and fly!
        </p>

        <p>
            So I started my own business in software development, user experience and user interface design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why 'untyped'?
        </p>

        <p>
            My name is not easy to remember nor to write, so I wanted to find a different name for my business.
        </p>

        <p>
            The term is derived from the <a href="#">lambda calculus</a> theory, which is 'untyped' in it's purest form.
        </p>

        <p>
            People tend to label everything... and I like to think I'm 'untyped'.
            (I think) A good software engineer should have a broad interest and should be eager to learn something new
            everyday.
            He should not stick to one programming language or framework, but choose the right tool for the job.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some contact info or form should come here!
