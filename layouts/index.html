            Hi, my name is Hugues Huygens,
            I'm a freelance software engineer specialised in web development with a strong focus on user experience and
            user
            interface design.
            After working a little more than 15 years as an employee under the wings of a big <a href="#">American
            company</a> the time had come to spread my wings and fly!
            So I started my own business in software development, user experience and user interface design.
            Why 'untyped'?
            My name is not easy to remember nor to write, so I wanted to find a different name for my business.
            The term is derived from the <a href="#">lambda calculus</a> theory, which is 'untyped' in it's purest form.
            People tend to label everything... and I like to think I'm 'untyped'.
            (I think) A good software engineer should have a broad interest and should be eager to learn something new
            everyday.
            He should not stick to one programming language or framework, but choose the right technology stack which
            best
            fits the job.
